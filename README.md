# Angular is a fairly new framework that allows one to build webpages and web apps that are responsive to user input and uses. Angular takes user input and can affect webpage elements on the fly, and without having to reload the page. This is far superior than old school methods of interactive web pages, where the input would be taken and the page would either have to reloaded or rerouted to have an effect. Additionally, as with most frameworks, the amount of code necessary to create applications is heavily reduced and made simpler. The main benefit is definitely the ability to have interactive content and be able to make alterations to documents in real time with both fewer keystrokes and it is completely done in the browser.

# In this particular example of an Angular web app, the user can input in a text box on the page and this makes alterations to the document user.json, the particular attribute being affected is the name attribute in the user file, and because the attribute is being affected on the user.json document it is changed in realtime in the browser window to reflect the alterations. Additionally, there is a file at the extension ./file, that allows the user to write to a file on the server called 'demofile1'. This file adds 'Hello Content!' to the file everytime the page loads. This is another example of Angulars ability to affect documents and data in real time, using almost exclusively browser side technology.
